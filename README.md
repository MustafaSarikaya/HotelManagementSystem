Go to the directory of the project in the terminal.
Run the following docker-compose build command:
Building with compose

`docker compose up -d --build`

Docker should install a database image of mariadb.
To instantiate our database you need to go to the terminal and run the following command:

`db-migrate up`

This command will run create table queries, will insert the seed data and will create indexes and views.
You can now run the project on terminal by this command:

`npm start`

The app should be live on http://localhost:8000/hms/api
